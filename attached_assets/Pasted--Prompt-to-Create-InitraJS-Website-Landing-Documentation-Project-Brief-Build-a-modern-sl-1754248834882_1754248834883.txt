⚙️ Tech Stack Preference:
Use React+vite application, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for smooth animations.
Integrate Three.js for subtle 3D visual animations on the landing page background to make the experience dynamic and tech-focused.
Embed CLI demo videos using Sora.

📈 SEO Optimization:
Ensure pages are SEO-optimized with correct metadata, OpenGraph tags, clean URL structure (/docs/..., /roadmap, /contributing), and fast-loading assets for high Lighthouse scores. Add schema markup for structured data.
